# VBA-unprotect-brute-force

This is a slightly modified version of code I found by several contributors on Stack Overflow. If you have an Excel workbook or worksheet that is protected, and you want to unprotect the sheet without removing the password, this will theoretically work. Depending on the complexity of the password, it can take days/weeks to run. The macro loops through every possible combination of alphanumeric characters in hopes of guessing the one that works.
